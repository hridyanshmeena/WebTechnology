1. Write a java program to compare two strings lexicographically (without using library
function).

2. Write a program to implement counting sort (with input in the range 0 to 20 and input
can be repeated multiple times)

3. Write a program to sort strings (using library function).

4. Write a ConsoleProgram that reads in a number from the user and then displays the
Hailstone sequence for that number (Pick some positive integer and call it n. If n is even,
divide it by two. If n is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Continue this process until n
is equal to one).

5. Print all possible ways to convert one string into another string. Given two strings str1
and str2, the task is to print the all possible ways to convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’ using string
inbuilt functions.
Below are the operations that can be performed on “str1”:
Insert
Remove
Replace
All of the above operations are of equal cost. The task is to print all the various ways to
convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’ using the minimum number of edits (operations) required, where
a “way” comprises of the series of all such operations required.
Examples:
Input: str1 = “abcdef”, str2 = “axcdfdh”
Output:
Method 1:
Add h

Change f to d
Change e to f
Change b to x
Method 2:
Change f to h
Add d
Change e to f
Change b to x
Method 3:
Change f to h
Change e to d
Add f
Change b to x
