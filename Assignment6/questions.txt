1. For division and multiplication two numbers should not be zero. If zero is
entered for any number then throw an exception in respective methods.
So design an exception handler (ArithmeticException) in multiply () and
Division () methods respectively to check whether any number is zero or
not.

2. For addition and subtraction, two numbers should be positive. If any
negative number is entered then throw an exception in respective
methods. So design an exception handler (ArithmeticException) in Add ()
and Subtract () methods respectively to check whether any number is
negative or not.

3. Write a main class and declare four objects of Calculator class. Perform
addition (obj1), subtraction (obj2), multiply (obj3) and division (obj4)
operations for these objects. If any non integer values are provided as
input; then you should throw an exception (NumberFormatException)
and display a message that informs the user of the wrong input.
