Q1. . Suppose that score is a variable of type double. Write the java statement that
increases the score by 5 marks if score is between 80 and 90.

Q2. Write the main() method of the MinOfThree class that determines which of the
three numbers is the smallest number, and displays that number using if-else
statement.(Note: You donâ€™t have to take input from user. )

Q3. Consider the index of the month (let say 1 for January). Write a java program to

Q4. A city of 80,000 peoples is increasing at the rate of 5% annually. When will
their population first exceed 150000? Write a java program for it. Use While Loop.

Q5. You are to write a program that generates the second, third, and fourth powers
of a list of whole numbers from 1 to n where n can be any number(Let say n=5).
Write a Java program to do this. Show output column headers (see below, n, n^2,
n^3, n^4). Then, use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n, computing each of that loop
variable to the second power, third power and fourth power. Assuming your loop
variable is called i, you can do this either as i*i or Math.pow(i,2).
n n^2 n^3 n^4
1 1 1 1
2 4 8 16
3 9 27 81
4 16 64 256
5 25 125 625

Q6. Write a do-while loop that will print out all the multiples of 3 from 3 to 36, that
is: 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 33 36.
